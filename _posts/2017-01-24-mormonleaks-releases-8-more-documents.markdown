2. Internal infographic that outlines the financial benefits for Mission Presidents

    *Note from the MormonLeaks&trade; Team:  The complete Mission Presidents manual was leaked a few years ago and can be [seen here](https://ia801808.us.archive.org/21/items/MissionPresidentsHandbook2006/Mission%20Presidents_%20Handbook-(2006).pdf).

    Refer to Appendix B of the manual for an outline of the financial benefits designated for Mission Presidents.  Today’s leaked infographic largely draws from the same information, however, there are a few points the infographic has that are not contained in the Mission Presidents manual.  Most notably is the instruction to not tell the Area Authorities about these financial arraignments.*

3. A financial report from October 2000 for the Polynesian Cultural Center
