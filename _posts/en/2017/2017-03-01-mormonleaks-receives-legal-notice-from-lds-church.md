On March 1, 2017 MormonLeaks received the following notice ordering us to take down the PowerPoint presentation that was leaked yesterday.  The LDS Church was also successful in getting docdroid.net to take down the document independent of any action on the part of MormonLeaks.

MormonLeaks is committed to making this an all other documents we receive available to the public.  We are currently working with our attorneys to find a solution that will allow us to make this document available again and avoid interruptions in the future.
