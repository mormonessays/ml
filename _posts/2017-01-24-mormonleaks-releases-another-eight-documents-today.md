2. Internal infographic that outlines the financial benefits for Mission Presidents

	[Document here](http://docdro.id/GZn8JbC)

	*Note from the MormonLeaks™ Team:  The complete Mission Presidents manual was leaked a few years ago and can be [seen here]( https://ia801808.us.archive.org/21/items/MissionPresidentsHandbook2006/Mission%20Presidents_%20Handbook-(2006).pdf)
	Refer to Appendix B of the manual for an outline of the financial benefits designated for Mission Presidents.  Today’s leaked infographic largely draws from the same information, however, there are a few points the infographic has that are not contained in the Mission Presidents manual.  Most notably is the instruction to not tell the Area Authorities about these financial arraignments.*

3. A financial report from October 2000 for the Polynesian Cultural Center

8. Audio recording from a sacrament meeting where M. Russell Ballard spoke along with David Archuleta and Savannah Stevenson.  At 14:42 Ballard can be heard praising some women from the early days of the church for ignoring their priesthood leaders (After Savannah Stevenson tells the story).  At 41:58 Ballard tells the crowd that one cannot truly celebrate Christmas without expressing gratitude for Joseph Smith.
